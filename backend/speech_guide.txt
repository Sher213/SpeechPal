Guide to Evaluating a Good Speech
=====================================

This guide serves as a knowledge base for assessing the quality of speech segments based on key metrics.

1. Metrics Overview
-------------------
- Duration (seconds): Length of the segment in seconds.
- Words Per Minute (WPM): Rate of speech; ideal range is 110–150 WPM.
- Clarity (0.0–1.0): Enunciation quality; higher is clearer.
- RMS Mean: Loudness/energy level; moderate consistency is best.
- Pitch Mean (Hz): Average pitch; variation is more important than absolute value.
- Detected Tone: Overall tone classification (e.g., confident, analytical).
- Sentiment Score (-1.0–1.0): Positive to negative emotional valence.
- Audio Emotion Scores: Breakdown of emotions (e.g., joy, confidence, fear).

2. 1–10 Rating System
----------------------
For each metric, assign a score from 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent):

- **Duration**:  
  1 = <2s or >15s (too short/long),  
  10 = 3–10s (ideal).

- **WPM**:  
  1 = <80 or >170,  
  10 = 110–150.

- **Clarity**:  
  1 = <0.5,  
  10 = ≥0.9.

- **RMS Mean**:  
  1 = Extremely low or high inconsistent levels,  
  10 = Consistent moderate level.

- **Pitch Variation**:  
  1 = Monotone (std dev <5 Hz),  
  10 = Dynamic variation (std dev ≥20 Hz).

- **Tone Appropriateness**:  
  1 = Mismatch to content,  
  10 = Perfect match (e.g., persuasive → confident).

- **Sentiment**:  
  1 = Highly negative or overly effusive,  
  10 = Balanced positive/neutral (0.1–0.5).

- **Emotional Expressiveness**:  
  1 = Flat or extreme negative,  
  10 = Balanced joy/confidence with subtle urgency (~20–40% joy, ~30–50% confidence, ~10–20% urgency).

3. Calculating Overall Score
----------------------------
- Compute each metric’s 1–10 score.
- Optionally apply weights (e.g., Clarity & WPM 20% each, others 10% each).
- Sum to a total out of 100, then scale to 1–10.

4. Detailed Example
-------------------
Segment Text:
"Our mission is to innovate and inspire every day."

Metrics:
- Duration: 4.50s → Score: 10
- WPM: 130.0 → Score: 9
- Clarity: 0.85 → Score: 8
- RMS Mean: 0.0500 → Score: 9
- Pitch Std Dev: 18.0 Hz → Score: 8
- Tone: confident → Score: 10
- Sentiment: 0.30 → Score: 9
- Emotions: {joy:0.35, confidence:0.45, urgency:0.15} → Score: 9

Weighted Scores (example weights in %):
- WPM (20%): 9 * 0.2 = 1.8
- Clarity (20%): 8 * 0.2 = 1.6
- Duration (10%): 10 * 0.1 = 1.0
- RMS (10%): 9 * 0.1 = 0.9
- Pitch (10%): 8 * 0.1 = 0.8
- Tone (10%): 10 * 0.1 = 1.0
- Sentiment (10%): 9 * 0.1 = 0.9
- Emotions (10%): 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Total = 1.8+1.6+1.0+0.9+0.8+1.0+0.9+0.9 = 9.0/10

Conclusion:
A score of 9/10 indicates a highly effective segment.
